# smw_romhack_autosplitter

A Super Mario World romhack autosplitter originally taken from [NecroSky90 on SMWCentral](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=28606) and updated to work with snes9x-1.6.1 or some other bug that occurred right around when I installed that Core!

## Changelog

### v0

- Fixed an issue in the original splitter by NecroSky90 caused by snes9x-rr v1.6.1 (probably)
- Cleaned up the individual level logic
- Got checkpoint splitting working
- Added fine-grained splits to Quickie World 2

## Roadmap

### v1

- Puragtory fine-grained splits
- Add fine-grained splits for other hacks and verify existing hacks still function
- Explain a methodology for adding fine-grained splits for any new hack that anyone can follow

### Beyond

- An automatic split generator
- Use TAS tech to create little unit test equivalents to ensure changes are mostly backwards compatible
