# smw_romhack_autosplitter

A Super Mario World romhack autosplitter originally taken from [NecroSky90 on SMWCentral](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=28606) and updated to work with snes9x-1.6.1 or some other bug that occurred right around when I installed that Core!

## Roadmap

I'm hoping to get a handle on how to get the splits more robust, working for more kaizo games automatically, and hopefully adding checkpoint splitting.
