Kaizosplits yay!

Installation

1) Install the DLLs for Livesplit to find
  - Find your LiveSplit folder
  - Copy `SMW.dll` into the `Components` folder inside the LiveSplit folder

2) Use the Kaiso.asl as your Scripable autosplitter
  - Put the `Kaizo.asl` somewhere. I keep it where I keep my splits files but it can be anywhere.
  - Open LiveSplit and `Edit Layout...` press `+` and then choose `Control > Scriptable Auto Splitter`
  - Now click `Layout Settings` and the `Scripable Auto Splitter` tab
  - Click `Browse` and go find your `Kaizo.asl` file

If all went well you should see a bunch of settings, with some checked. You're set!
